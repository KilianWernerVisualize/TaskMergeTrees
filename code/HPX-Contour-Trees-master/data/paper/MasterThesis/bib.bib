abstract="Abstract.  We present algorithms for constructing a hierarchy of increasingly coarse Morse---Smale complexes that decompose a piecewise linear 2-manifold. While these complexes are defined only in the smooth category, we extend the construction to the piecewise linear category by ensuring structural integrity and simulating differentiability. We then simplify Morse---Smale complexes by canceling pairs of critical points in order of increasing persistence.",
